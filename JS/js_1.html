1.Develop a Web page that prompts the user for 10 words, and then displays them in form of a list in two different ways: 

	
a) In the order in which the words were entered.

	
b) In a sorted order
	
	
2.Write a JavaScript program to get the volume of a Cylinder with four decimal places using object classes.
	Volume of a cylinder : V = pi*r^2*h
	where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.
	
3.Write a JavaScript program to create a Clock.
	Note: The output will come every second.
	
4.Write a JavaScript function to print all the methods in a JavaScript object.

1. Write a JavaScript function that reverse a number.  
Example x = 32243; 
Expected Output : 34223 
 
2. Write a JavaScript function that checks whether a passed string is palindrome or not?  
A palindrome is word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run. 
 
3. Write a JavaScript function that generates all combinations of a string.  
Example string : 'dog' 
Expected Output : d,do,dog,o,og,g 
 
4. Write a JavaScript function that returns a passed string with letters in alphabetical order.  
Example string : 'webmaster' 
Expected Output : 'abeemrstw' 
Assume punctuation and numbers symbols are not included in the passed string. 
 
5. Write a JavaScript function that accepts a string as a parameter and converts the first letter of each word of the string in upper case.  
Example string : 'the quick brown fox' 
Expected Output : 'The Quick Brown Fox ' 
 
6. Write a JavaScript function that accepts a string as a parameter and find the longest word within the string. 
Example string : 'Web Development Tutorial' 
Expected Output : 'Development' 
 
7. Write a JavaScript function that accepts a string as a parameter and counts the number of vowels within the string.  
Note : As the letter 'y' can be regarded as both a vowel and a consonant, we do not count 'y' as vowel here. 
Example string : 'The quick brown fox' 
Expected Output : 5 
 
8. Write a JavaScript function that accepts a number as a parameter and check the number is prime or not.  
Note : A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. 
 
9. Write a JavaScript function which accepts an argument and returns the type.  
Note : There are six possible values that typeof returns: object, boolean, function, number, string, and undefined. 
 
10. Write a JavaScript function which returns the n rows by n columns identity matrix.  
 
11. Write a JavaScript function which will take an array of numbers stored and find the second lowest and second greatest numbers, respectively.  
Sample array : [1,2,3,4,5] 
Expected Output : [2,4] 
. 
12. Write a JavaScript function which says whether a number is perfect.  
According to Wikipedia : In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself). 
Example : The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2, and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors: ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6. The next perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. This is followed by the perfect numbers 496 and 8128. 
. 
13. Write a JavaScript function to compute the factors of a positive integer.  
14. Write a JavaScript function to convert an amount to coins.  
Sample function : amountTocoins(46, [25, 10, 5, 2, 1]) 
Here 46 is the amount. and 25, 10, 5, 2, 1 are coins. 
Output : 25, 10, 10, 1 
. 
15. Write a JavaScript function to compute the value of bn where n is the exponent and b is the bases. Accept b and n from the user and display the result.  
. 
16. Write a JavaScript function to extract unique characters from a string.  
Example string : "thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog" 
Expected Output : "thequickbrownfxjmpsvlazydg" 
. 
17. Write a JavaScript function to  get the number of occurrences of each letter in specified string.
